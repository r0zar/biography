Please create a Covey weekly progress review:

1. Read the current month's comprehensive analysis at $CURRENT_MONTH_ANALYSIS
2. Read the current ADHD tasks at $ADHD_TASKS_FILE 
3. Read the most recent daily summary files in $VAULT_DIR (files named 2025-*.md from this week)

Create 'Weekly-Covey-Review-${TIMESTAMP}.md' in $VAULT_DIR with:

**HEADER INFORMATION:**
- Review Date: ${DATE_READABLE}
- Week of: ${WEEK_OF}
- Current Task Completion Rate: ${COMPLETION_RATE}% (${CHECKBOX_COMPLETED}/${CHECKBOX_TOTAL})
- Data Snapshot: Based on $QUESTION_COUNT total biography responses

**WEEKLY REVIEW SECTIONS:**

### Progress Assessment
- Brief review of key accomplishments this week
- Areas where progress was made toward monthly goals
- Patterns observed in daily summaries and task completion

### Challenge Areas Identified  
- Tasks or areas with low completion rates
- Obstacles that emerged this week
- Gaps between intentions and actions

### Next Week Focus
- 3-5 specific actions for the coming week
- Priorities based on monthly plan + this week's learnings
- Adjustments to approach based on what's working/not working

### Progress Questions for User
Generate 2-3 targeted questions about areas needing attention, formatted for notification system:
- Questions should be yes/no or binary choice format  
- Focus on areas with <50% completion or identified challenges
- Use format: "Question text?" â†’ Button options: "Option1/Option2"

**STYLE NOTES:**
- Keep it concise (2-3 pages max vs comprehensive monthly analysis)
- Focus on actionable insights for next week
- Reference specific items from monthly plan
- Use Covey principles but don't repeat full framework
- Include internal links to relevant topics

This is a progress review, not a new comprehensive analysis. Build on the existing monthly plan.
