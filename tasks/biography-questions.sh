ESSENTIALIST_PROMPT="Please perform essentialist question prioritization:

SYSTEM INFO:
- OS: $(uname -s) $(uname -r)
- Desktop: ${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP:-Unknown}
- Display: ${DISPLAY:-Not set}

CONTEXT LOADING:
1. Read the agent instructions at $ESSENTIALIST_PROMPT_FILE
2. Read Priority Management file at $VAULT_DIR/Priority-Management.md
3. Read Covey analysis at $COVEY_FILE
4. Read mission statement at $MISSION_FILE
5. Read current ADHD tasks file at $VAULT_DIR/ADHD-Tasks.md to identify the top priority areas

TASK:
1. Identify the single most important priority from the ADHD tasks file (morning discipline, job performance, etc.)
2. Scan the relevant topic files for existing unanswered questions (‚ùå) related to that priority
3. If suitable question exists, select it for presentation
4. If no suitable question exists, create a new essential question that:
   - Addresses the specific ADHD task priority identified
   - Can be answered with actionable yes/no or specific options
   - Helps overcome the current completion rate bottlenecks (17% job apps, 29% morning discipline)
   - Add this new question to the most appropriate topic file with ‚ùå status
5. Present the selected/created question using the most appropriate dialog interface

DIALOG PRESENTATION:
- PREFERRED: If question is short (under 80 characters) and has simple yes/no or 2-3 option responses, use notify-send with action buttons for lightweight interaction
- FALLBACK: For longer/complex questions, use dialog tools like zenity
- Format question text properly for shell execution (escape quotes, etc.)
- Create appropriate button options based on question type
- For notifications: Use notify-send with -A parameters for interactive responses
  * Returns numeric index: 0=first button, 1=second button, etc.  
  * More reliable than dialog windows for text visibility
  * Integrates naturally with desktop environment
- For dialogs: Current GTK_THEME is set to: ${GTK_THEME:-default}
- Handle response and update markdown file with proper status and timestamp"
